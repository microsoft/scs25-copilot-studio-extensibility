Welcome to the **Copilot Studio Extensibility Workshop** at South Coast Summit 2025! 🚀

## 📋 Workshop Overview

In this comprehensive workshop, we will guide you through the complete extensibility landscape of Copilot Studio, starting with core extensibility concepts and then diving deep into connector development and MCP (Model Context Protocol). You'll discover how to go from static AI interactions to dynamic experiences that truly understand and integrate with your data through APIs.

## 🎯 What You'll Take Away

By the end of this workshop, you will have:

- ✅ **Comprehensive understanding** of Copilot Studio's extensibility points
- ✅ **Hands-on experience** building custom connectors and implementing MCP
- ✅ **Strategic guidance** on selecting the right extensibility approach for different use cases and technical requirements

## 👥 Prerequisites
